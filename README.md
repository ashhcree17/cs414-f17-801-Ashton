Project 1.0: Let the games begin!

In this project, I am to develop a software system to support the management of an indoors
gym. 

The system to be developed allows the manager of a gym to manage trainers, customers, and
equipment. The system also allows trainers to manage workout routines for the customers.
The system should provide the features described next.
